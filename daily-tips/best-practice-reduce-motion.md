# Respect reduced motion
Keep animations minimal when users prefer less motion.

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  * {
    animation-duration: 0.01ms !important;
    animation-iteration-count: 1 !important;
    transition-duration: 0.01ms !important;
  }
}
```

Why it helps: reduces motion sickness and meets accessibility needs.
